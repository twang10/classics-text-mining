==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''Andorra'' is unknown, although several theories have been formulated. The oldest derivation of the word ''Andorra'' is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] ([[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]] III, 35, 1) who describe the [[Iberians|Iberian]] ''Andosins'' [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribes]], historically located in the valleys of Andorra, facing the [[Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word ''Andosini'' or ''Andosins'' (Aνδοσίνους) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is &quot;big&quot; or &quot;giant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diccionari&quot;&gt;''Diccionari d'Història de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; ISBN 84-297-3521-6; p. 42; entrada &quot;Andorra&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of [[Basque language]] in the area. Another theory suggests that the word ''Andorra'' may derive from the old word ''Anorra'' that contains the Basque word ''ur'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Font Rius |first=José María |title=Estudis sobre els drets i institucions locals en la Catalunya medieval |url=http://books.google.es/books?id=JQL6rtB8VtQC&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Anorra+andorra&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DcwZT6_ALYzs-gaKmt3OCg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anorra%20andorra&amp;f=false |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |year=1985 |pages=743 |isbn=8475281745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory suggests that ''Andorra'' may derive from [[Arabic]] ''al-Darra'', whose meaning is &quot;The Forest&quot; (الدرا). When the [[Moors]] invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the valleys of the Pyrenees were formed by large tracts of forest and other regions and towns, also dominated by Muslims, received this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Andorra, the Hidden Republic: Its Origin and Institutions, and the Record of a Journey Thither|year=1912|pages=9|last=Gaston|first=L. L.|publisher=McBridge, Nast &amp; Co|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] ''andurrial'', which means &quot;land covered with bushes&quot; or &quot;scrubland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary. &quot;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Andorra Andorra].&quot; Accessed 16 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[folk etymology]] holds that [[Charlemagne]] had called the region as a reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Cannan|Canaanite]] valley of ''[[Endor (village)|Endor]]'' or ''[[Endor (village)|Andor]]'' (where the [[Midianites]] had been defeated), a name also bestowed by their heir and son [[Louis le Debonnaire]] after defeating the Moors in the &quot;wild valleys of Hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of the Medieval Peasant|pages=189|last=Freedman|first=Paul|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=CA, USA|year=1999|isbn=9780804733731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Andorra}}
[[File:Església de Sant Joan de Caselles - 10.jpg|left|thumb|Sant Joan de Caselles church, dating from the 11th century.]]
Tradition holds that Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the [[Moors]]. [[Feudalism|Overlordship]] of the territory was by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the bishop of the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. In 988, [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has owned Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked for help and protection from the [[Lord of Caboet]]. In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger Bernat II]], the French [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of [[Aragon]] by the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia and divided it in four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).

===20th century===
[[File:Borís Skósyrev.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boris Skossyreff]], briefly self-proclaimed &quot;King of Andorra&quot; in 1934.]]
Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of [[belligerency]] until 1958 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DYKAndorra&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=World War I Ends in Andorra |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 September 1958 |page=66 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E6DF1530E73BBC4D51DFBF668383649EDE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On 12 July 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain), as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors, as the members of the legislative branch are called. The Councillors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council. The Councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies.

Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected from a single national constituency. 15 days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament]]

Candidates for the nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==

Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1993-16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=30 June 1993 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the ''Sometent'' (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/?q=en/node/281 |title=El Sometent &amp;#124; Tourism |publisher=Turisme.andorralavella.ad |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recarrega.net/arxius/Decret%20veguers%20Sometent,%20del%2023%20d%27octubre%20de%201984.pdf |title=Decret veguers Sometent, del 23 d'octubre de 1984 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a fire-arm in case of need.&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;/&gt; Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the ''Sometent''. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no [[navy]].

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities. Despite not being involved in any fighting, Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and technically remained at war with Germany from 1914 until 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYKAndorra&quot;/&gt;

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French [[National Gendarmerie]],&lt;!-- Reference removed, as site quoted is currently on WP blacklist --&gt; with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' – Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of Major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time voluntaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.&lt;ref&gt;An example from the United States [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm State Department] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An alternative [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Andorra-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html example] of the report.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], or [[non-commissioned officer]]s, because the [[Enlisted rank|other ranks]] are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the ''Sometent'' to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

===GIPA===
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|Army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.&lt;ref&gt;Police structures [http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html detailed here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police Corps ===
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small, but modern and well-equipped internal police force with around 240 police officers, supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and bomb disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire brigade===
The ''Andorran Fire Brigade'', with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), 4 light support vehicles (cars and vans), and 4 ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. The serious fires (which lasted for two days) in parts of the principality in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the ''Andorran Fire Brigade'' was formed on 21 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time – two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Andorramap.png|thumb|right|Map of Andorra with its seven parishes labelled.]]
{{main|Geography of Andorra|Geology of Andorra}}

===Parishes===
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}
Andorra consists of seven parishes:
* [[Andorra la Vella]]
* [[Canillo]]
* [[Encamp]]
* [[Escaldes-Engordany]]
* [[La Massana]]
* [[Ordino]]
* [[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

===Physical geography===
[[File:Grandvalira ski resort, Andorra5.jpg|thumb|right|Scenery of Andorran mountains]]
[[File:Andorra topographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Andorra]]

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. ISBN 99913-9-063-4. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300&amp;nbsp;days per year of sunshine.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}
[[File:Caldea.jpg|thumb|right|Caldea spa in [[Escaldes-Engordany]], heated by natural [[hot spring]] water which is plentiful in the parish.]]
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]]
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;/&gt; attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is as a result of tourism from ski resorts which total to over {{convert|175|km|0|abbr=on}} of ski ground. The impact of skiing on the Andorra economy has been tremendous, bringing over 7 million visitors a year. It is currently estimated to generate 340 million euro per year, 2000 direct jobs and 10000 indirect jobs.

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;&gt;[http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf Andorra and its Financial System. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;). The financial system comprises 5 banking groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Andorra List of Banks in Andorra]&lt;/ref&gt; 1 specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the Principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;/&gt;

Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra – European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009, it stood at 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran duty-free shopping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[sales tax]] of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of [[income tax]] by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra &quot;bringing its taxation in line with international standards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}

===Population===
The population of Andorra is estimated to be 85,082 (July 2011).&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Andorran nationals form a plurality, but not a majority, in the country (31,363 / 33%);&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;Departament d'Estadistica, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; other nationalities include Spaniards (27,300 / 23%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; Portuguese (13,794 / 21%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; French (5,213 / 17%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; British (1,085 / 1%)&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; and Italians.

Two-thirds of the population is made up of citizens without Andorran nationality, who do not have the right to vote (suffrage) in communal elections. Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president{{clarify|date=October 2014}} or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/Parlamento/andorrano/facilita/hijos/residentes/adquisicion/nacionalidad/elpepiint/19850801elpepiint_23/Tes/ El País 01/08/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/examen/ser/andorrano/elpepiint/19851027elpepiint_18/Tes/ El País 27/10/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/RIBAS/_oSCAR/MARTi_ALANiS/_JOAN_/ARZOBISPO_DE_URGELL/ANDORRA/Constitucion/Andorra/seguira/limitando/derechos/poblacion/elpepiint/19920509elpepiint_5/Tes/ El País 09/05/1992], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Andorra/solo/inmigrantes/sanos/elpporint/20060714elpepisoc_8/Tes/ El País 14/07/2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government  encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, '&amp;#39;Council of Europe'&amp;#39;, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (90%) Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Fact Book&amp;nbsp;– Andorra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group{{clarify|date=August 2014}}. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The [[Islam in Andorra|Muslim community]] is primarily made up of the approximately 2,000 North African immigrants who, according to the U.S. State Department, are themselves divided between fundamentalists and non-fundamentalists. There is a small community of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Andorra|Bahá'ís]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ARDA05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International - Regions - Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = [[Wolfram Alpha]] | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram – Alpha (curated data) | date = 13 March 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/ | accessdate = 6 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51537.htm |title=US Dept of State information |publisher=State.gov |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[History of the Jews in Andorra]]).

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of schools&amp;nbsp;– Andorran, French and Spanish&amp;nbsp;– which use Catalan, French and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic program, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d’Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programs and continuing-education courses for professionals.

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, [[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]] (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;&gt;''Travailler en Andorre'' (May 2006), Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;/&gt;

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.cass.ad/web/lacass/professionalSalut/hospitals/Andorra |title=List of specialties with coverage by CASS at Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell (2009) |publisher=Online.cass.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the Principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;/&gt;

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Andorra}}
[[File:Latour-de-Carol station - 2004-02-02.jpg|thumb|A train at [[Latour-de-Carol]] (''La Tor de Querol''), one of the two stations serving Andorra. Andorra has no railways, although the line connecting Latour-de-Carol and [[Toulouse]], which in turn connects to France's [[TGV]]s at Toulouse, runs within two kilometres of the Andorran border.]]

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]]. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no railways, ports, or airports for fixed-wing aircraft in Andorra. There are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]] (Camí Heliport), [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services.&lt;ref name=&quot;heliand&quot;&gt;Heliand&amp;nbsp;– Serveis (2009). [http://www.heliand.com/ Heliand.com] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;helitrans&quot;&gt;Helitrans&amp;nbsp;– Services (2009). [http://www.helitrans.ad/ Helitrans.ad] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby airports are located in Barcelona, Toulouse, Perpignan, Reus, and Girona. The closest public airport is [[Perpignan - Rivesaltes Airport]], which is {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} away and has short-haul services to several destinations in the United Kingdom and France. [[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]], a small airfield in northern Spain close to the Andorran border and currently used only by private airplanes, is being studied as a possible future airport for public aviation services.&lt;ref name=&quot;gdc2008&quot;&gt;La Generalitat es reuneix amb els pobles afectats per l'aeroport (31 October 2008).

==Media and telecommunications==
{{update|section|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as ''Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra'' (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;somfo&quot;&gt;SOM Newsletter, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability was complete in June 2012.

There is only one Andorran television station, ''[[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]]'' (RTVA). ''Radio Nacional d’Andorra'' operates two radio stations, ''[[Radio Andorra]]'' and ''Andorra Música''. There are three national newspapers, ''[[Diari d'Andorra]]'', ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', and ''[[Bondia (newspaper)|Bondia]]'' as well as several local newspapers.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{see also|Music of Andorra}}
[[File:HPIM0309.JPG|thumb|right|Andorran flag on balcony, Ordino]]
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the [[contrapàs]] and [[marratxa]], which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in [[Andorra la Vella]] and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]] Day, 8 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; American Folk Artist [[Malvina Reynolds]], intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song &quot;Andorra&quot;. Pete Seeger added verses, and sang &quot;Andorra&quot; on his 1962 album ''The Bitter and the Sweet''.

==Sports==
Andorra is famous for the practice of [[Winter Sports]]. Popular sports played in Andorra include [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]], basketball and [[Roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]].

In [[Roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] Andorra usually plays in [[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|CERH Euro Cup]] and in [[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup]]. In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the [[2011 European League Final Eight]].

[[File:Estadi Comunal Aixovall.jpg|thumb|[[Estadi Comunal d'Andorra la Vella]]]]
The country is represented in association football by the [[Andorra national football team]]. However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorra's small population.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=and/ranking/gender=m/index.html |title=FIFA Rankings – Andorra |publisher=Fifa.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Football is ruled in Andorra by the [[Andorran Football Federation]] founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football ([[Primera Divisió]], [[Copa Constitució]] and [[Andorran Supercup|Supercopa]]) and [[futsal]]. [[FC Andorra]], a club based in [[Andorra la Vella]] founded in 1942, compete in the [[Spanish football league system]].

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a traditional sport in Andorra, mainly influenced by the popularity in southern France. The [[Andorra national rugby union team]], nicknamed &quot;''Els Isards''&quot;, has impressed on the international stage in [[rugby union]] and [[rugby sevens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/rankings/sportid=1/news/newsid=2070876.html#usa+andorra+improve+rating+rankings USA and Andorra improve rating in rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; [[VPC Andorra XV]] is a rugby team based in [[Andorra la Vella]] actually playing in the French championship.

Basketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s when the Andorran team [[BC Andorra]] played in the top league of Spain ([[Liga ACB]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2012/11/13/baloncesto/basketfeb/1352828175.html El BC Andorra quiere volver a la Liga más bella]&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 years the club returned to the top league in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2014/03/22/532e12b2e2704e1a3d8b457f.html El River Andorra regresa a la ACB 18 años después]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports practiced in Andorra include [[cycling]], volleyball, [[judo]], [[Australian rules football|Australian football]], [[handball]], swimming, gymnastics, tennis and [[motorsports]]. In 2012, Andorra raised its first national [[cricket]] team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club, the first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of {{convert|1300|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netherlands Based FFOP CC Beats Andorra National Team|url=http://www.cricketworld.com/netherlands-based-ffop-cc-beats-andorra-xi/32216.htm|work=Cricket World|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra first participated at the [[Olympic Games]] in 1976. The country has also appeared in every [[Winter Olympic]] Games since 1976. Andorra competes in the [[Games of the Small States of Europe]] being twice the host country in [[1991 Games of the Small States of Europe|1991]] and [[2005 Games of the Small States of Europe|2005]].

'''Aruba''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|uː|b|ə}} {{respell|ə|ROO|bə}}; {{IPA-nl|aːˈrubaː}}) is an [[island]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], located about {{convert|1600|km}} west of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and {{convert|29|km|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37333/Aruba|title=Aruba|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; north of the coast of [[Venezuela]]. It measures {{convert|32|km|0}} long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and {{convert|10|km|0}} across at its widest point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], Aruba forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Collectively, Aruba and the other [[Dutch Caribbean|Dutch islands in the Caribbean]] are often called the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or the [[Dutch Caribbean]].

Aruba is one of the four [[Constituent country|constituent countries]] that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].

Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|179|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside [[Hurricane Alley]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Aruba}}
[[File:Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|left|The capital [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]]

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been [[Caquetios Indian|Caquetíos Amerinds]] from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] tribe, who migrated there from [[Venezuela]] to escape attacks by the [[Kalina people|Caribs]]. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, [[Caquetio]] culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, Ojeda was likely first, learning of it from natives of nearby islands.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Both described Aruba as an &quot;island of giants&quot;, remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans. Gold was not discovered on Aruba for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.&lt;ref name=advent&gt;{{cite book |last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire &amp; Curaçao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57–58| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&amp;lpg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite book | last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&amp;lpg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Aruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. ''Simas,'' the ''[[Cacique]]'' or [[Tribal chief|chief]] in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of ''Nueva Andalucía.''

Arawaks spoke the &quot;broken Spanish&quot; which their ancestors had learned on [[Hispaniola]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Another governor appointed by Spain was [[Juan Martínez de Ampiés]]. A ''cédula real'' decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the [[Welser|House of Welser]].

The Netherlands have covered the island with their regulations since 1629. Since 1636, Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration, initially governed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the [[Dutch West India Company]] (W.I.C.) administration, as &quot;New Netherland and Curaçao,&quot; from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as &quot;Commandeur&quot; in Aruba.

The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|reason=no direct linkage has been supplied to demonstrate that one lead to the other|date=August 2012}}

In August 1806, General [[Francisco de Miranda]] and a group of 200 freedom fighters, traveling to liberate Venezuela from Spain, stayed in Aruba for several weeks.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1933, Aruba sent its first petition to the Queen seeking independent status and autonomy.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During [[World War II]], Aruba was one of the main suppliers of refined petroleum products to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the war, after the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]], Aruba was made a British [[protectorate]] from 1940 to 1942, and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.

On 16 February 1942, a German submarine (''[[German submarine U-156 (1941)|U-156]]'') under the command of Werner Hartenstein attacked the island's oil processing refinery, but the mission failed.

In March 1944, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the [[First Lady of the United States]], briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were Curaçao Governor P. Kasteel, and U.S. Rear Admiral [[Theodore E. Chandler|T. E. Chandler]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Move towards independence ===
In August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution), for Aruba's ''[[status aparte]]''{{disambiguation needed|date=January 2015}} as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. By 1954, the [[Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robbers|first=Gerhard|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|volume=1|year=2007|location=New York City|page=649|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;lpg=PA649|isbn=0-8160-6078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname]], [[Betico Croes]] (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a ''sui-generis'' Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each to have its own nationality. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or ''Status Aparte'' as a full autonomous state under the Crown.

Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Aruba Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20211986 |title=BBC News - Aruba profile - Timeline |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]] to prepare a study for independence; it was titled ''Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg'' (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978). At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.

After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''. At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's [[Nelson Oduber|Prime Minister]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

== Geography ==
[[File:Aruba map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A map of Aruba]]
{{main|Geography of Aruba}}

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern part of the Caribbean. It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aruba: the happy island&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Canoe inc. |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Travel/Activities/SunSand/2011/06/22/18320936.html |title=Aruba: the happy island |publisher=Slam.canoe.ca |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where most tourist development has occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aruba: the happy island&quot; /&gt; The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.

The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at {{convert|165|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and [[Mount Jamanota]], the highest on the island at {{convert|188|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

To the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]].

The [[Aruba Natural Bridge|Natural Bridge]] was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Aruba}}

[[File:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.60|Population of Aruba 1961–2003, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.]]

The population is estimated to be 80% mixed Black/White/Caribbean native Americans and 20% other ethnicities.

The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians, Africans, and Dutch, and to a lesser extent of Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, Sephardic Jewish ancestors.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of Aruba}}
The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and – since 2003 – [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A [[creole language]] spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot;), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke &quot;Spanish&quot;. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=2011-06-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta''; and three in English: ''Aruba Daily&quot;, &quot;Aruba Today'' and ''The News''. ''Amigoe'' is the newspaper published in Dutch. Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations ([[Telearuba]], Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).

=== Regions ===
For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Aruba}}

[[File:Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange.jpg|thumb|[[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] is the [[head of state]] of Aruba]]
[[File:Parlamento di Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].]]
As a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member [[parliamentary democracy|Parliament]] and an eight-member Cabinet. The [[governor of Aruba]] is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or &quot;Parlamento&quot;) for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arubaforeignaffairs.com/afa/readBlob.do?id=694|title=Political Stability|accessdate=2011-06-07 |work= |publisher=Aruba Department of Foreign Affairs|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Netherlands]], the countries of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the [[European Union]], though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.&lt;ref name=euprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm |title=EU Relations with Aruba |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110609050531/http://eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |title=Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model. Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, the ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba'' ([[Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx Aruba.com]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPA-districts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. By 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Key Indicators General Government, 1997–2006|url=http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&amp;id=927|accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aruba received some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as &quot;Aruba's Financial Independence&quot;) in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.

In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.

== Education ==
Aruba's educational system is patterned after the [[Education in the Netherlands|Dutch system of education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaerts (Transitional times)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/redsox/2013/09/03/usa-today-minor-league-player-of-the-year-xander-bogaerts-boston-red-sox/2760091/ |title=Bogaerts: USA TODAY Sports' Minor League Player of Year |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Aruba finances the national education system. Private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Arubans have a primary school system, followed by a segmented secondary school program which includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The study of Spanish, English, Dutch and French is offered in secondary school and college, since a high percentage of students continue their studies in Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Higher education is available through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Aruba is also home to two [[medical schools]]: [[Aureus University School of Medicine]] and [[Xavier University School of Medicine]].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Aruba}}

Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. There is a low unemployment rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Its main trading partners are [[Venezuela]], the United States and the [[Netherlands]].

[[File:Aruba export map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A graphical breakdown of Aruba's economy by exports]]
The island's economy has been dominated by five main industries: tourism, [[gold mining]], [[phosphate]] mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), [[aloe]] export, and [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] (The Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Before the &quot;Status Aparte&quot; (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The official exchange rate of the [[Aruban florin]] is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg |title=Convert Dollars to Aruba Florin &amp;#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Currency.me.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx |title=Convert United States Dollar to Aruban Florin &amp;#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Themoneyconverter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that currency fluctuates slightly because of the necessity of forcing the florin to the dollar by buying or selling florins or dollars---&gt; Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.

===Tourism===
About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism or related activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South-America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of (mainland) the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles. No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands has the [[Euro]]), Euros are still not widely accepted but can be  easily exchanged at a local bank for [[Aruban Florin]]s.

For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport. United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986. It began as a USDA and Customs post. Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Military===
In 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] established a [[Forward Operating Site|Forward Operating Location]] (FOL) at the airport.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There is also a small Dutch marines base by Savaneta containing approximately 120 Dutch Marines and about 100 AruMil forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Aruba}}
{{See also|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles}}

[[File:Centrum Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|Ornate buildings in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]].]]
On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

Aruba has a varied culture. According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of &quot;[[Sinterklaas]]&quot; on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 30 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen's birthday or &quot;Dia di La Reina&quot; ([[Koninginnedag]]) is celebrated.
[[File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iguana]]s on a rooftop in Aruba.]]

Christmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and &quot;[[Hallaca|ayaca]]&quot;, &quot;[[ponche crema]]&quot;, ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on June 24.

Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are holidays on the island.

The holiday of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Curaçao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.

== Infrastructure ==
Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad. According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.

Arubus is a government-owned bus company. Its buses operate from 3:30&amp;nbsp;am until 12:30&amp;nbsp;am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

===Communications===
There are three telecommunications providers: [[SetarNV|Setar]], a government-based company, [[Mio Wireless]] and [[Digicel]], both of which are privately owned. Setar is the provider of services such as internet, video conferencing, [[GSM]] wireless technology and land lines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Digicel]] is Setar's competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform, and [[Mio Wireless]] provides wireless technology and services using CDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mioaruba.com/products|title=Mio Wireless Products|accessdate=2014-08-25 |work= |publisher=Mio Wireless|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ankara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ŋ|k|ə|r|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ankara?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Ankara|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-tr|ˈaŋ.ka.ɾa|3=Ankara pronunciation.ogg}}; historically known by the names '''Ancyra''' and '''Angora''') is the capital of [[Turkey]] and the country's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second largest]] [[List of cities in Turkey|city]], [[Istanbul]] being the largest. The city has a mean elevation of {{convert|sp=us|938|m|ft}} and in 2014 had a population of 5,150,072, with its [[metropolitan municipality]] having 4,965,542.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapor.tuik.gov.tr&quot;&gt;[http://rapor.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2&amp;ENVID=adnksdb2Env&amp;report=wa_buyukbelediye.RDF&amp;p_kod=1&amp;p_yil=2011&amp;p_dil=1&amp;desformat=html Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu (TÜİK) – Büyükşehir belediyeleri ve bağlı belediyelerin nüfusları – 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/68/Ankara.html Ankara, Turkey: Latitude, Longitude and Altitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the center of the [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish Government]], and an important commercial and industrial city. Located in [[Central Anatolia]], Ankara is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the center of Turkey's highway and railway networks, and serves as the marketing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The city is traditionally famed for its long-haired [[Angora goat]] and its prized wool ([[mohair]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]), [[Angora rabbit]]s and their prized [[Angora wool]], pears, honey, and the region's [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes.

The historical center of Ankara is situated upon a rocky hill, which rises {{convert|150|sp=us|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the plain on the left bank of the ''Ankara Çayı'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya River|Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, which is 72&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx|title=Municipality of Ankara: Green areas per head |publisher=Ankara.bel.tr |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankara is a very old city with various [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Phrygia]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[archaeological site]]s. The hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which adds to the picturesqueness of the view, but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to the present day. There are, however, many well-preserved remains of [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] and [[Roman architecture]], the most remarkable being the Temple of [[Augustus]] and Rome (20 BC) which is also known as the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html |title=LacusCurtius • Monumentum Ancyranum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date=|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] cult center '''Ankuwaš''',&lt;!--or Ankuwa, but not Ankuwash--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;qgmpff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialscience.tjc.edu/mkho/fulbright/1998/turkey/turman3.htm |title=Judy Turman: Early Christianity in Turkey |publisher=Socialscience.tjc.edu |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xtxpyw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/seyahat/4407373_p.asp |title=Saffet Emre Tonguç: Ankara (Hürriyet Seyahat) |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this remains a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorny&quot;&gt;Gorny, Ronald L. &quot;Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.C.&quot; ''The Journal of the American Oriental Society''. Vol. 117 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as {{lang|grc|'''Ἂγκυρα'''}} (''Ánkyra'' &quot;[[anchor]]&quot;) in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and '''Ancyra''' in [[Latin]]; the [[Galatian language|Galatian Celtic]] name was probably a similar variant. Following its annexation by the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as '''Angora''', a usage which continued until its official international renaming to '''Ankara''' under the Turkish Postal Service Law of 28 March 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/ankara.htm |title=Ankara |publisher=I-cias.com |date=3 September 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ankara|Timeline of Ankara}}
[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] artifacts on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]

The region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rûm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]].)

===Ancient history===
The oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed ca. 2000–1700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., &quot;Ancyra was actually older even than that.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of [[Pontus|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name ''Áγκυρα'' (''Ànkyra'', meaning ''[[Anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.

===Celtic history===
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230–220&amp;nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe. Other centers were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].

===Roman history===
[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

The city was subsequently conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC and passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. Now the capital city of the Roman province of Galatia, Ancyra continued to be a center of great commercial importance. Ankara is also famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments.

Augustus decided to make Ancyra one of three main administrative centers in central Anatolia. The town was then populated by Phrygians and Celts—the ''Galatians'' who spoke a language somewhat closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]. Ancyra was the center of a tribe known as the ''Tectosages'', and Augustus upgraded it into a major provincial capital for his empire. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved in the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]
[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212–217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out 80m x 120m classical complex.]]

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara Çayı]], ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected. The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of the most brilliant queens of the ancient world, the Arab empress [[Zenobia]] from [[Palmyra]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284–305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eskişehir]]).

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town. In this period, like other cities of central Anatolia,

== Christianity ==

Early Christian martyrs of Ancyra, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of Kallippi, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98–117). In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.

[[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]]

As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]]; which considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of 'lapsi'—Christians who had given in and conformed to [[paganism]] during these persecutions.

[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|upright|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.]]

Three councils were held in the former capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, during the 4th century. The first, an orthodox plenary synod, was held in 314, and its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. Nine of them deal with conditions for the reconciliation of the lapsi; the others, with marriage, alienations of church property, etc.

Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.

The synod of 358 was a [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] [[conciliabulum]], presided over by [[Basil of Ancyra]]. It condemned the grosser Arian blasphemies, but set forth an equally heretical doctrine in the proposition that the Son was in all things similar to the Father, but not identical in substance.

In 362–363, the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as ''&quot;Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations&quot;'', can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]].

In the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408–450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]]. Although Ancyra temporarily fell into the hands of several Arab Muslim armies numerous times after the 7th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century. It was also the capital of the powerful [[Opsikion|Opsician Theme]], and after ca. 750 of the [[Bucellarian Theme]].

Ancyra, known in the West also as Angora, continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian Genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''], in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

===Turkish history===
[[File:Atatürk TBMM'den çıkarken.jpg|thumb|250px|President [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (center) and Prime Minister [[İsmet İnönü]] (left) leaving the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] during the 7th anniversary celebrations of the Turkish Republic in 1930.]]
In 1071, the Turkish [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] conquered much of [[Sultanate of Rum|eastern and central Anatolia]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and [[natural resource]]s, to his territory in 1073. After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, in which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Ankara as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat at [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul) and much of [[Anatolia]] were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Ankara in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yenişehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on [[Kızılay Meydanı|Kızılay Square]], has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital. It was &quot;a small town of no importance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer&lt;/ref&gt; when it was made the capital of Turkey. In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781.

==Climate==
Ankara has a hot-summer [[continental climate]] (''Dsa''). Due to its elevation and inland location, Ankara has cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn. Under [[Köppen climate classification]], Ankara borders on a [[dry summer continental climate]] with a warm summer subtype (''Dsb''), and is near the borderline of a [[cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''), with some regions of the province having a true warm summer subtype (''Dsb'') of continental climate, depending on elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/World_Koppen_Map.png |title=World Map of the Köppen−Geiger climate classification |publisher=University of Melbourne |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Ankara's high altitude and its dry summers, nightly temperatures in the summer months are cool. Ankara's annual average precipitation is fairly low at {{convert|sp=us|408|mm|0}}, nevertheless precipitation can be observed throughout the year. Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|0.3|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|23.5|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{convert|12.02|°C|1}}.

[[File:Ankara at night.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Ankara [[metropolitan area]]]]
[[File:Su perileri ankara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kızılay Square]] in Ankara, during the early years of the Turkish Republic, with the later demolished ''Su Perileri'' (Water Fairies) monumental fountain, c. 1930.&lt;ref name=Gezenadam&gt;[http://www.gezenadam.com/gezinotlari/dbtrips.php?ID=223 Gezenadam: &quot;Susuz Su Perileri&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SuPerileri&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ankara/16575415.asp Hürriyet: &quot;İnat değil kent kazandı&quot; (20-12-2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. In 2013, Ankara has a population of 5,045,083 of which 2,507,525 are men and 2,537,558 are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey pop 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/jsp/duyuru/upload/adnks_Harita_TR/HaritaTR.html Türkiye istatistik kurumu] Address-based population survey 2007. Retrieved on 9 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

Historically, the production of [[mohair]] from the [[Angora goat]], and [[Angora wool]] from the [[Angora rabbit]], have been an important part of the city's economy. These fabrics have been exported from Ankara to Europe and other parts of the globe for centuries.

The [[Central Anatolia Region]] is one of the primary locations of grape and [[Turkish wine|wine production in Turkey]], and Ankara is particularly famous for its [[Kalecik Karası]] and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat grapes]]; and its [[Kavaklıdere (winery)|Kavaklıdere wine]], which is produced in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] neighbourhood within the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] district of the city. Ankara is also famous for its pears. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of [[honey]] (''Ankara Balı'') which is known for its light color and is mostly produced by the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

Ankara is the center of the state-owned and private Turkish [[Arms industry|defence]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] companies, where the industrial plants and headquarters of the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]], [[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKE]], [[ASELSAN]], [[Havelsan]], [[Roketsan]], [[FNSS Defence Systems|FNSS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnss.com.tr/ FNSS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nurol Makina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nurolmakina.com.tr/ Nurol]&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other firms are located. Exports to foreign countries from these defence and aerospace firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF]] in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global [[arms industry]]. A number of the global [[automotive industry|automotive companies]] also have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer [[MAN SE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.man.com.tr/ MAN Türkiye]&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara hosts the [[OSTIM Industrial Zone]], Turkey's largest [[industrial park]].

A large percentage of the complicated employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish government. There are also many foreign citizens working as diplomats or clerks in the [[embassy|embassies]] of their respective countries.

Ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), the opposition [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] centre-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) and the nationalist far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). The [[Ankara Province|province of Ankara]] is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of [[Çankaya]], which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 to 70% of the vote in Çankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within Çankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]]. In retrospect, the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|2013-14 protests against the AKP government]] were particularly strong in Ankara, proving to be fatal on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/ethem-sarisuluk-killed-turkey-protests_n_3390502.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melih Gökçek]] has been the Metropolitan Mayor of Ankara since 1994 as a politician from the [[Welfare Party]]. He later joined the [[Virtue Party]] and then the AKP. Initially elected in the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]], he was re-elected in [[Turkish local elections, 1999|1999]], [[Turkish local elections, 2004|2004]] and [[Turkish local elections, 2009|2009]]. In the [[Turkish local elections, 2014|2014 local election]], Gökçek stood for a fifth term. The MHP metropolitan mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections, conservative politician [[Mansur Yavaş]], stood as the CHP candidate against Gökçek. In a heavily controversial election, Gökçek was declared the winner by just 1% ahead of Yavaş amid allegations of systematic electoral fraud. With the [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] and courts rejecting Yavaş's appeals, he has declared intention to take the irregularities to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. Although Gökçek was inaugurated for a fifth term, most election observers believe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Dikmen Vadisi, Ankara 3.jpg|thumb|Dikmen Valley Park]]

Ankara has many parks and open spaces mainly established in the early years of the Republic and well maintained and expanded thereafter. The most important of these parks are: [[Gençlik Parkı]] (houses an [[amusement park]] with a large pond for rowing), the [[Botanical garden]], Seğmenler Park, Anayasa Park, [[Kuğulu Park]] (famous for the swans received as a gift from the [[PRC|Chinese]] government), [[Abdi İpekçi]] Park, Güven Park (see above for the monument), Kurtuluş Park (has an ice-skating rink), [[Altınpark]] (also a prominent exposition/fair area), Harikalar Diyarı (claimed to be Biggest Park of Europe inside city borders) and Göksu Park.

Gençlik Park was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 100 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1952–1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].

[[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] (''Atatürk Orman Çiftliği'') is an expansive recreational farming area which houses a [[zoo]], several small agricultural farms, [[greenhouse]]s, restaurants, a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] and a brewery. It is a pleasant place to spend a day with family, be it for having picnics, hiking, biking or simply enjoying good food and nature. There is also an exact replica of the house where Atatürk was born in 1881, in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece. Visitors to the &quot;Çiftlik&quot; (farm) as it is affectionately called by Ankarans, can sample such famous products of the farm such as old-fashioned beer and [[ice cream]], fresh [[dairy product]]s and meat rolls/kebaps made on charcoal, at a traditional restaurant (''Merkez Lokantası'', Central Restaurant), cafés and other establishments scattered around the farm.

===Shopping===
[[File:Ankara Atakule.JPG|thumb|left|[[Atakule Tower]] (1989)]]
[[File:A view of Sheraton Ankara from Karum Shopping Mall.JPG|thumb|[[Sheraton Ankara]] rising behind [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum shopping mall]] in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] quarter of the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] business and leisure district.]]

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' Road) near Ulus, where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found at bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in [[Kızılay, Ankara|Kızılay]], or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria]]n merchant colonies called [[Kültepe#Kârum Kaneš|''Kârum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city. [[Atakule|Atakule Tower]] next to [[Atakule#Atrium shopping mall|Atrium Mall]] in Çankaya commands a magnificent view over Ankara and also has a [[revolving restaurant]] at the top, where the city's panorama can be enjoyed in a leisurely fashion. The symbol of the [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Armada Shopping Mall]] is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]].

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eskişehir]] Road. The ''Armada'',''CEPA'' and ''Kentpark'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'', ''Arcadium'' and ''Gordion'' in Ümitköy, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eskişehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region. In 2014 a few more shopping malls were open in Ankara. They are ''Next Level'' and ''Taurus'' on the Boulevard of [[Mevlana]] (also known as [[Konya]] Road).

===Archeological sites===

====Ankara Citadel====
[[File:Ankara Castle walls.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ankara Castle|Ankara citadel walls]]]]
[[File:MonumentumAncyranum28Nov2004.jpg|thumb|In the ''Temple of Augustus and Rome'' (commonly known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]) in Ulus, the primary intact copy of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] written by the first Roman emperor [[Augustus]] survives.]]

The foundations of the [[Ankara Castle|Ankara castle and citadel]] were laid by the Galatians on a prominent [[lava]] outcrop ({{Coord|39.941|N|32.864|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}), and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine.

The citadel was depicted in various Turkish banknotes during 1927–1952 and 1983–1989.&lt;ref&gt;The citadel was depicted in the following Turkish banknotes:
* On the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the 1 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927–1939 (1. Emission Group – One Turkish Lira – [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/6.htm I. Series]).
* On the obverse of the 5 lira banknote of 1927–1937 (1. Emission Group – Five Turkish Lira – [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/10.htm I. Series]).

====Roman Theatre====
The remains, the stage, and the backstage of the Roman theatre can be seen outside [[Ankara Castle|the castle]]. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]]. The seating area is still under excavation.

====Temple of Augustus and Rome====

The temple, also known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], was built between 25&amp;nbsp;BC – 20&amp;nbsp;BC following the conquest of Central Anatolia by the [[Roman Empire]] and the formation of the Roman province of [[Galatia]], with Ancyra (modern Ankara) as its administrative capital. After the death of Augustus in 14 AD, a copy of the text of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]] was inscribed on the interior of the ''pronaos'' in Latin, whereas a Greek translation is also present on an exterior wall of the ''cella''. The temple, on the ancient Acropolis of Ancyra, was enlarged by the Romans in the 2nd century. In the 5th century it was converted into a church by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. It is located in the Ulus quarter of the city.

====Roman Baths====
The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] have all the typical features of a classical [[Thermae|Roman bath complex]]: a ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold room), a ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm room) and a ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot room). The baths were built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] in the early 3rd century AD to honor [[Asclepius|Asclepios]], the God of Medicine. Today, only the basement and first floors remain. It is situated in the Ulus quarter.

==Fauna==

===Angora cat===
{{Main|Turkish Angora}}
[[File:Odd-eyed Turkish Angora cat - 20080830.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora cat]]]]

Ankara is home to a world famous domestic [[cat breed]] – the [[Turkish Angora]], called ''Ankara kedisi'' (Ankara cat) in Turkish. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

===Angora rabbit===
{{Main|Angora rabbit}}

[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora rabbit]]]]

The [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tavşanı}}) is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called &quot;wool block&quot; is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds – How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit|accessdate=29 January 2009 |work=|publisher=|date=| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml| archivedate= 25 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

===Angora goat===
{{Main|Angora goat}}
[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora goat]]]]

The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara keçisi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between five and eight kilograms of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938–1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].

Adelaide stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach]] in the south.

Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], [[queen consort]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the city was founded in 1836 as the [[new town|planned capital]] for a freely-settled British province in Australia. [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the [[River Torrens]], in the area originally inhabited by the [[Kaurna people]]. Light's design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]]. Early Adelaide was shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to political [[progressivism]] and civil liberties, which led to the moniker &quot;City of Churches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1455 Religion: Diversity], SA Memory. Retrieved on 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] along the cultural boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]], [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]] and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its food and wine, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. It ranks highly in terms of liveability, being listed in the Top 10 of ''[[The Economist]]'s'' World's Most Liveable Cities index in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2010/02/liveability_rankings|title=Liveability rankings|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/melbourne-beats-sydney-in-worlds-most-liveable-city-rankings-20110221-1b29d.html|title=404|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/08/liveability-ranking|title=Liveability ranking|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also ranked the [[most liveable city]] in Australia by the Property Council of Australia in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/22/3118843.htm?section=business |work=[[ABC News|ABC News Online]] |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=22 January 2011 |title=Adelaide crowned nation's most livable city |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/adelaide-voted-nations-most-liveable/story-e6frea83-1226309173646 |work=[[AdelaideNow]] |publisher=News Corporation |date=25 March 2012 |title=Adelaide voted nation's most liveable |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/adelaide-the-countrys-most-liveable-city-20130304-2ffeh.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=News Corporation |date=4 March 2013 |title=Adelaide the country's most liveable city |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Adelaide}}
[[File:Kaurnaland.png|thumb|left|upright|Approximate extent of Kaurna territory, based on the description by Amery (2000)]]

===Before European settlement===
Prior to its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] nation (pronounced &quot;Garner&quot; or &quot;Gowna&quot;).

Kaurna culture and language was almost completely destroyed within a few decades of the European settlement of South Australia in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/adelaide_history/adelaide_brief_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both language and culture.

===19th century===

[[File:Adelaide supplement to the Illustrated Sydney News.png|thumb|right|In July 1876, the Illustrated Sydney News published a special supplement that included an early aerial view of the City of Adelaide, the River Torrens and portion of North Adelaide from a point above Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide.]]
South Australia was officially proclaimed as a new British colony on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North, South Australia|Glenelg North]]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as [[Proclamation Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463|title=City of Holdfast Bay - Proclamation Day|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect [[George Strickland Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Langmead, [http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1082509 ''The Adelaide city plan: fiction and fact''], Wakefield Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Light had fondly written of the Sicilian city of [[Catania]]: &quot;The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile long&quot;, and this became the basis for the plan of Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Light chose, not without opposition, a site on rising ground close to the River Torrens, which was the chief water supply for the fledgling colony. &quot;[[Light's Vision]]&quot;, as it has been termed, has meant that the initial design of Adelaide required little modification as the settlement grew and prospered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield cites:
* Edward Curr, ''An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land, principally designed for the use of emigrants'', George Cowie &amp; Co., London, 1824;
* Henry Widdowson, ''Present State of Van Diemen's Land; comprising an account of its agricultural capabilities, with observations on the present state of farming, &amp;c. &amp;c. pursued in that colony: and other important matters connected with Emigration'', S. Robinson, W. Joy and J. Cross, London, and J. Birdsall, Northampton, 1829; and
* James Atkinson, ''An Account of the State of Agriculture &amp; Grazing in New South Wales; Including Observations on the Soils and General Appearance of the Country, and some of its most useful natural productions; with an account of the Various Methods of Clearing and Improving Lands, Breeding and Grazing Live Stock, Erecting Buildings, the System of employing Convicts, and the expense of Labour generally; the Mode of Applying for Grants of Land; with Other Information Important to those who are about to emigrate to that Country: The result of several years' residence and practical experience in those matters in the Colony''., J. Cross, London, 1826
&lt;/ref&gt; while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, ''Letter from Sydney'', December 1829, pp. 99–185, written from Newgate prison. Editor Robert Gouger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield wrote about this under a pseudonym, purporting to be an Australian settler. His subterfuge was so successful that he confused later writers including [[Karl Marx]], who wrote &quot;It is the great merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the Colonies, but to have discovered in the Colonies the truth of as to the condition of capitalist production in the mother-country.' ''Das Kapital'', Moscow, 1958, p 766&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land.&lt;ref&gt;''Plan of a Company to be Established for the Purpose of Founding a Colony in Southern Australia, Purchasing Land Therein, and Preparing the Land so Purchased for the Reception of Immigrants'', 1832; in Wakefield, Edward Gibbon, Prichard, M. F., (ed.) ''The Collected Works of Edward Gibbon Wakefield'', Collins, London, 1968, p 290.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share [[Convictism in Australia|the convict settlement history]] of other Australian cities like [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hobart]].
[[File:North Terrace, 1841.jpg|thumb|right|North Terrace in 1841]]
As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|right|upright=1.0|1888 Map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]
Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period and land was promptly offered for sale to early colonists. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.

[[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler's public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Blair, Robert D.| year=2001| title=Events in South Australian History 1834–1857 | work=Pioneer Association of South Australia |url=http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm | accessdate=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.

Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but, with the return of droughts, endured the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, later returning to prosperity under strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Seventy thousand men and women enlisted&lt;!-- When? To do what? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].
[[File:North Terrace in 1938.jpg|thumb|Intersection of North Terrace and [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]] viewed from [[Parliament House, Adelaide|Parliament House]], 1938.]]
The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]&lt;ref&gt;When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory. After many years of mixed fortunes, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing at Tonsley Park on 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from [[Mannum, South Australia|Mannum]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1954 and [[Adelaide International Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 immigrants of many nationalities, mainly European, to South Australia between 1947 and 1973.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} [[Flinders University]] and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the City.

The [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan Governments]] of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival', establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial &quot;[[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]&quot; which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands; it then moved to Melbourne in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;f1-move&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Adelaide Street Circuit | publisher=Formula 1 Database |url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit | accessdate =13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] collapsed during the then economic recession, with its effects lasting until 2004, when ratings agency [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = All-round country |work=The Australian | page = 14 | date = 29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1999, the [[Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] race has made use of sections of the former Formula One circuit. Adelaide's tallest building, built in 1988, was originally known as the State Bank Building. In 1991 it was renamed the Santos Building and in 2006 it was again renamed [[Westpac House]].

===21st century===
[[File:Adelaide central business district at night.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Adelaide central business district at night, 2013.]]
In the early years of the 21st century there was a significant increase in the State Government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure. The [[Mike Rann|Rann Government]] invested $535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable [[Australian Football League|AFL]] to be played in the city centre&lt;ref&gt;Michael Owen, The Australian, 3 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and more than $2 billion to build a new [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, Wednesday 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 6 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a period of stagnancy in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide has began several major developments and redevelopments. The Adelaide Convention Centre was redeveloped and expanded at a cost of $350 million beginning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Three historic buildings were adapted for modern use: the Torrens building in Victoria Square as the Adelaide campus for Carnegie Mellon University, University College London and Torrens University;&lt;ref&gt;News Release Government of SA, 15 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Stock Exchange building as the Science Exchange of the Royal Institution Australia; and the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital as the Adelaide Studios of the [[South Australian Film Corporation|SA Film Corporation]]. The government also invested more than $2 billion to build a [[desalination]] plant, powered by renewable energy, as an 'insurance policy' against droughts affecting Adelaide's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Harmsen, ABC News, Sept 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arts the [[Adelaide Festival]], [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe]] and [[Womadelaide]] became annual events.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide Advertiser 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Adelaide Hills aerial.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of fields in the [[Adelaide Hills]]]]
[[File:Adelaide metropolitan area map.svg|upright=0.6|thumb|Adelaide's metropolitan area]]
Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the Adelaide Metropolitan Region has a total land area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is at an average elevation of {{convert|50|m|ft|}} above sea level. [[Mount Lofty]], east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of {{convert|727|m|ft|}}, is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]].

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] supplying around 40% and the much larger [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

On 1 March 1954 at 3:40&amp;nbsp;am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre at [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]], and a reported magnitude of 5.6.&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Urban layout===
{{Main|Light's Vision}}

[[File:King William Street-Adelaide.jpg|thumb|right|King William Street, one of the widest main streets in an Australian capital city, viewed from Victoria Square.]]
Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's design was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh. Light persisted with his design against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable grid layout and a beautiful green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''], 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and &quot;country towns&quot;, as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning. The newer suburban areas as a whole, however, are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas, and therefore place more stress on Adelaide's transportation system – although not on a level comparable with Melbourne or Sydney.

In the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&amp;nbsp;million as the first of these developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 &quot;Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village&quot;], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

====Housing====
{{Main|Australian residential architectural styles}}
Historically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} blocks. A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings.
[[File:Adelaide-NthTce-EastEnd-TerraceHouses-Aug08.jpg|thumb|right|A row of [[terrace houses]] at the east end of North Terrace.]]
There is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick, and to a lesser degree, stone, and/or stone-faced, single-storey detached houses. After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks were popular; in the 1960s, cream bricks were popular; in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks were popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of &quot;double brick&quot; construction upon &quot;dwarf wall&quot; foundations. Progressively since then there has been a move to &quot;[[brick veneer]]&quot; over a timber frame on a concrete slab foundation, and more recently, over a steel frame. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the [[South Australian Housing Trust]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, many of the older houses were demolished and replaced by &quot;home units&quot; - a group of three-to-five single-storey dwellings on a common title with shared access. Two-storey blocks of flats were also common in this period. [[Dutch Colonial]] architecture is rare in Adelaide, but there are a few noteworthy examples in the style popularised in the United States, in the 1960s. The style was brought to South Australia by George Gavin Lawson. In the 21st century, a significant factor is the government policy of &quot;Urban infill&quot;, where single-storey detached houses are being demolished, the land subdivided, and double-storey semi-detached &quot;town-houses&quot; are being built in their place.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}
Adelaide has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapper |first=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; with hot dry summers and mild winters, with most [[precipitation]] falling in the winter months. Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid [[Köppen]]'s BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&amp;nbsp;mm. [[Frosts]] are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is uncommon, except for very light falls at [[Mount Lofty]] and some places in the Adelaide Hills, with the most recent occurrence being on 1 August 2014 at Mount Lofty. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from 8C to 10C. The historical maxima and minima for Adelaide are {{convert|45.7|°C|°F}} on [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|28 January 2009]] and {{convert|-0.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on 8 June 1982.

So far, the city has seen three of these proposed risks. Nine of Adelaide's ten warmest years ever recorded have occurred in the last decade: from 2002 to 2014. Summer 2013-14 was the hottest summer on record, with a record number of 13 days exceeding {{convert|40|°C|°F}}, while Autumn 2014 was the warmest autumn ever recorded in Adelaide's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/02/11/3942071.htm|title=Adelaide's hottest summer on record|work=ABC Online|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer, in January 2015, bushfires burned out of control after days of extreme heat conditions in [[Sampson Flat, South Australia]] which then spread towards the outer northern suburbs of Adelaide, toward [[Greenwith, South Australia|Greenwith]] and [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/bushfires-five-sa-homes-destroyed-victoria-braces-for-more-blazes/story-e6frg6nf-1227173295988|title=Bushfires: five SA homes destroyed, Victoria braces for more blazes|work=[[The Australian]]|date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heatwave and fires caused widespread destruction, health problems and fatalities. The number of heat-related deaths in Adelaide is expected to more than double by 2030.

Adelaide is affected by the [[urban heat island]] effect in some areas which is caused by human activity (air-conditioning, traffic, vehicle emissions),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.javeriana.edu.co/arquidis/educacion_continua/documents/Urbanclimates.pdf|title=￼Urban climates and heat islands: albedo, evapotranspiration, and anthropogenic heat|work=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|location=[[Berkley, California]]|date=1997|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/K8/bennet.pdf|title=Increased Urban Heat Island Effect due to Building Height Increase|work=[[Flinders University]]|date=2013|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; altering  temperatures compared to the surrounding rural areas and intensifying the heat in the inner-city region. The urban heat island phenomenon can cause temperatures to be {{convert|10|°C|°F}} higher in the city than in surrounding areas. The urban heat island effect is increased as the demand for high-rise buildings in the CBD grows, because urban heat islands are often caused by the absorption of heat from tall buildings in concentrated areas. Additionally, the growth in Adelaide's metropolitan area has also led to degradation of the environment as the [[urbanization]] has eradicated large spaces of natural [[vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/people/bill.becker|title=Quantifying the urban heat island effect on Adelaide's coastline|first=Bill|last=Becker|work=[[The University of Adelaide]]|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various mitigation strategies have been proposed, including increasing [[park land|urban green space]] across the city, constructing sustainable [[Sustainable design|green design buildings]] and installing [[solar panels]] on city buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/form/article/green-spaces-can-combat-urban-heat-stress|title=Green Spaces Can Combat Urban Heat Stress|work=The Adelaide Review|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A $1.2 million research initiative by the Urban Climates Research began in July 2013. The study aims to identify cost-effective strategies for mitigation of urban heat islands in Australian cities, with the primary goal of reducing heat stress in Australian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanclimates.org/the-project/|title=The Project|work=Urban Climates Research|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image.

Some 76.7%{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.

Major areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS2011&quot; /&gt;

About one sixth (17.1%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 29.8% of the total population. Suburbs including [[Newton, South Australia|Newton]], [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]] and [[Campbelltown, South Australia|Campbelltown]] in the east and [[Torrensville, South Australia|Torrensville]], [[West Lakes, South Australia|West Lakes]] and [[Fulham, South Australia|Fulham]] to the west, have large [[Greek Australian|Greek]] and [[Italian Australian|Italian]] communities. The Italian consulate is located in the eastern suburb of [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]]. Large [[Vietnamese Australian|Vietnamese]] populations are settled in the north-western suburbs of [[Woodville, South Australia|Woodville]], [[Kilkenny, South Australia|Kilkenny]], [[Pennington, South Australia|Pennington]], [[Mansfield Park, South Australia|Mansfield Park]] and [[Athol Park, South Australia|Athol Park]] and also [[Parafield Gardens, South Australia|Parafield Gardens]] and [[Pooraka, South Australia|Pooraka]] in Adelaide's north. Migrants from [[Indian Australian|India]] and [[Sri Lankan Australian|Sri Lanka]] have settled into inner suburban areas of Adelaide including the inner northern suburbs of [[Blair Athol, South Australia|Blair Athol]], [[Kilburn, South Australia|Kilburn]] and [[Enfield, South Australia|Enfield]] and the inner southern suburbs of [[Plympton, South Australia|Plympton]], [[Park Holme, South Australia|Park Holme]] and [[Kurralta Park, South Australia|Kurralta Park]].

[[File:Adelaide Chinatown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinatown, Adelaide|Chinatown]] on Moonta St in the [[Adelaide Central Market|Market precinct]].]]

Suburbs such as [[Para Hills, South Australia|Para Hills]], [[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]], [[Ingle Farm, South Australia|Ingle Farm]] and [[Blair Athol, South Australia|Blair Athol]] in the north and [[Findon, South Australia|Findon]], [[West Croydon, South Australia|West Croydon]] and [[Seaton, South Australia|Seaton]] in the West are experiencing large migration from [[Afghan Australian|Afghanistan]] and [[Iranian Australian|Iran]]. [[Chinese Australian|Chinese migrants]] favour settling in the eastern and north eastern suburbs including [[Kensington Gardens, South Australia|Kensington Gardens]], [[Greenacres, South Australia|Greenacres]], [[Modbury, South Australia|Modbury]] and [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]]. [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] has a large international student population, due to its proximity to the [[University of South Australia]] campus. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (7.0%), Italy (1.6%), India (1.4%), China (1.3%) and [[Vietnam]] (1.0%). The most-spoken languages other than [[Australian English|English]] were Italian (2.6%), Greek (1.9%), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.3%), and [[Cantonese]] (0.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS2011&quot; /&gt;{{better source|date=February 2014}}

===Age structure===
Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55&amp;nbsp;years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), who comprised 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS2011&quot; /&gt;

===Religion===

Adelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance which attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as ''The City of Churches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1455 |title=Religion: Diversity |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1466 |title=Religious freedom |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia.
Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Catholic]] (21.3%), [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] (12.6%), [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] (7.6%) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/4GADE?opendocument&amp;navpos=220|title=2011 Census – Greater Adelaide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jews|Jewish]] community of the city dates back to 1840. 8 years later, 58 Jews lived in the city.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00409.html Adelaide], Jewish Virtual Library, Encyclopaedia Judica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[synagogue]] was built in 1871, when 435 Jews lived in the city. Many Jews took part in the city councils, such as Judah Moss Solomon (1852–66) and others after him. Three Jews have been elected to the position of city mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/793-adelaide Adelaide], JewishEncyclopedia.com, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, the Jewish population of Adelaide numbered about 1,200; in 2001, according to the Australian census, 979 persons declared themselves to be Jewish by religion.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; In 2011, over 1,000 Jews were living in the city, operating an [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and a [[Reform Judaism|reform]] school, in addition to a virtual Jewish museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adelaidejmuseum.org Adelaide Jewish Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The &quot;[[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan]]&quot; community in Australia first became established in the 1860s when camels and their Pathan, Punjabi, Baluchi and Sindhi handlers began to be used to open up settlement in the arid interior of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Westrip |first1=J. |last2=Holroyde |first2=P. |year=2010 |title=Colonial Cousins: a surprising history of connections between India and Australia |publisher=[[Wakefield Press]] |location=[[Kent Town, South Australia]] |isbn=978-1-86254-841-1 |ol=24582860M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until eventually superseded by the advent of the railways and later, motor vehicles, they played an invaluable economic and social role in transporting heavy loads of goods to, and products from, isolated settlements and mines. This role is acknowledged by the name of [[The Ghan]], the passenger train operating between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin. The [[Central Adelaide Mosque]] is regarded as the oldest permanent mosque in Australia; however an earlier [[Marree Mosque|mosque at Marree]] in northern South Australia, dating from 1861–62 and subsequently abandoned or demolished, has now been rebuilt.

Manufacturing, defence technology, high tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries all play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the [[General Motors Holden]] plant in [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.southaustralia.biz/fact_sheets/fact_automotive.biz.pdf|date =20110726013520}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adelaide has over 40% of Australia's high-tech electronics industry which designs and produces electronic systems that are sold worldwide for applications in medical, communications, defence, automotive, food and wine processing and industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The revenue of Adelaide's electronics industry has grown at about 15% per annum since 1990, and in 2011 exceeds A$4 billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The electronics industry in Adelaide employs over 12,000 people or 14% of all manufacturing employment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  The South Australian economy, very closely tied to Adelaide's, still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralia.biz/PDFs/economic_performance_update_dec05.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State Bank of South Australia|collapse of the State Bank in 1992]] resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4&amp;nbsp;billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which was a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralia.biz/news/sa_creditrating.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in, and until 2004 incorporated in, Adelaide and it is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos (company)|Santos]], prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]], major national retailer [[Harris Scarfe]] and Australia's second largest listed investment company [[Argo Investments Limited]] also call Adelaide their home.

===Defence industry===
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1&amp;nbsp;billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. Seventy-two percent of Australian defence companies are in Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The principal government military research institution, the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]], and other defence technology organisations such as [[BAE Systems Australia]] and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called &quot;Edinburgh Parks&quot;, adjacent to [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].

Others, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near [[Technology Park, Adelaide|Technology Park]]. [[ASC Pty Ltd]], based in the industrial suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]]. South Australia was charged with constructing Australia's [[Collins class submarine|''Collins'' class submarines]] and more recently the A$6&amp;nbsp;billion contract to construct the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s new [[Hobart class destroyer|air-warfare destroyers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencesa.com/ ''South Australia: The Defence Industry Choice''], Defence SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment statistics===
There are 466,829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% full-time and 35.1% part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The median weekly individual income for people aged 15&amp;nbsp;years and over was $447 per week in 2006, compared with $466 nationally.

===Primary and secondary education===
At the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and [[Catholic school]]s. All schools provide education under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.

===Tertiary education===

While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the [[vine cuttings]] that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

After the Second World War, British, Italian, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Polish people|Polish]] and other European immigrants settled in Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The conclusion of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975 saw an influx of Indo-Chinese immigrants to Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''See: [[Immigration history of Australia]]''

===Arts and entertainment===
Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and, in 1976, the [[State Opera of South Australia]].

Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Adelaide Writers' Week]], and [[WOMADelaide]], all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]] celebration), [[Tasting Australia]] (a biennial food and wine affair), and the [[Royal Adelaide Show]] (an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]]).

There are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Schützenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]]. Adelaide is home to the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], the world's largest [[Santa Claus parade|Christmas parade]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As the state capital, Adelaide is home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection. Adjacent are the [[South Australian Museum]] and [[State Library of South Australia]], while the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]], [[National Wine Centre]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]] are nearby in the [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the [[Migration Museum, Adelaide|Migration Museum]], Australia's oldest museum of its kind. Contemporary art scenes include the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia]]. [[Adelaide Festival Centre]], on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]], with other venues including the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] and the city's many smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars.

The [[music of Adelaide]] has produced musical groups and individuals who have achieved national and international fame. This includes the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], rock bands [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Wolf &amp; Cub]], roots/blues group [[The Audreys]], internationally acclaimed metal acts [[I Killed The Prom Queen]] and [[Double Dragon (band)|Double Dragon]], popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]], pop acts like [[Sia Furler|Sia]], [[Orianthi]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Wes Carr]], as well as internationally successful tribute act, The [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]].

Noted rocker [[Jimmy Barnes]] spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]]. Paul Kelly grew up in Adelaide and was head prefect at Rostrevor College. The first ''[[Australian Idol]]'' winner, [[Guy Sebastian]], hails from the north-eastern suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]]. American musician [[Ben Folds]] used to base himself in Adelaide when he was married to Australian Frally Hynes. Folds recorded a song about Adelaide before he moved away. In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including [[Big Day Out]], [[Creamfields Australia|Creamfields]], [[Future Music Festival|Future Music]], [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway]], [[Parklife Festival|Parklife]], [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]], [[Stereosonic]] and [[Summadayze]]

Adelaide plays host to two of Australia's leading contemporary dance companies. The [[Australian Dance Theatre]] and [[Leigh Warren &amp; Dancers]] contribute to state festivals and perform nationally and internationally. [[Restless Dance Theatre]] is also based in Adelaide and is nationally recognised for working with disabled and non-disabled dancers to use movement as a means of expression.

====Concert venues====
Adelaide pop-concert venues (past and present) include [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]]; [[Adelaide Festival Theatre]]; [[Adelaide Oval]]; [[Apollo Stadium]]; [[Memorial Drive Park]]; [[Thebarton Theatre]]. Other concert and live theatre venues include [[Adelaide Town Hall]]; [[Dunstan Playhouse]]; Her Majesty's Theatre.

===Media===
[[File:Advertiser Building.JPG|right|thumb|[[Keith Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch House]], named after the founder of ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'', is the headquarters for the publisher of Adelaide's daily newspaper, ''The Advertiser''.]]

====Newspapers====
Newspapers in Adelaide are dominated by [[News Corporation]] publications—Adelaide being the birthplace of News Corporation itself. The only South Australian daily newspaper is ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', published by News Corporation six days a week. The same group publishes a Sunday paper, the ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''.

There are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the ''[[Messenger Newspapers]]'', also published by a subsidiary of News Corporation. ''[[The Independent Weekly]]'' was a small independent newspaper providing an alternative view, but abolished its print edition in November 2010 and now exists as a digital daily newsletter only. Two national daily newspapers are circulated in the city: ''[[The Australian]]'' and its weekend publication, ''The Weekend Australian'', also published by News Corporation; and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' published by [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]]. Interstate dailies, ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published by Fairfax, are also typically available. ''[[The Adelaide Review]]'' is a free paper published fortnightly, and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.

====Television====
All of the five Australian national television networks broadcast [[High-definition television|high definition digital]] services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of Mount Lofty. Two other transmission sites are located at Grenfell Street and Elizabeth Downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital television reception in Craigmore/Hillbank|url=http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/128912/Craigmore-Hillbank_Fact_Sheet_-_Final_-_Web_ready.pdf|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two government-funded stations are run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC1) and the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS One). The [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]] both own their Adelaide stations ([[SAS-7]] and [[ADS-10]] respectively).

Adelaide's [[NWS-9]] is part of the [[Nine Network]]. New digital-only channels available in addition to ABC1, Seven, Nine, Ten and SBS One include [[One HD]], [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]], [[ABC2]], [[ABC3]], [[ABC News 24]], [[SBS Two]], [[7Two]], [[7mate]], [[GEM HD]] and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]]. Adelaide also has a [[Community television in Australia|community television]] station, [[44 Adelaide]]. The [[Foxtel]] [[pay TV]] service is available as cable television in a few areas, and as satellite television to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

As part of a nation-wide phase-out of [[analogue television]] in Australia, Adelaide's analogue television service was shut down on 2 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myswitch.digitalready.gov.au/default.aspx?search=5000|title=mySwitch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
There are twenty radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four community stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area. Of the twenty full coverage stations, there are six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations. A complete list can be found at [[List of radio stations in Australia#Adelaide]].

==Sport==
[[File:Adl utd stadium.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hindmarsh Stadium]] hosts [[Adelaide United]].]]
The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are [[Australian rules football]], [[association football|association football (soccer)]], [[cricket]], [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Crows]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]], and one [[A-League]] soccer team, [[Adelaide United]]. A local [[Australian rules football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of (currently) ten teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1907. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/17/australian-sport-owes-much-to-little-old-adelaide/|title=Australian sport owes much to little old Adelaide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the completion of the 2012-2014 renovation and upgrade of the [[Adelaide Oval]], most large sporting events took place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] (the then home base of the [[Adelaide Crows]], and the then [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide's]] home game venue), or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] and the [[Adelaide Strikers]] cricket teams. Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows &amp; Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.
[[File:Adelaide Oval, 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adelaide Oval]] is the home of [[Australian rules football]] and [[Cricket]] in [[South Australia]].]]
Since 1884, [[Adelaide Oval]] has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[One Day International]] cricket matches. [[Memorial Drive Park]], adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including (until 2009) the Adelaide International (now known as the [[Brisbane International]]). Adelaide's professional association football team, [[Adelaide United]], play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia.

For two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level [[rugby league]], after the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval starting in 1991. The [[Adelaide Rams]] were formed and played in the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] (SL) competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]] before moving to the new [[National Rugby League]] in [[1998 NRL season|1998]]. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a deal with the NRL, the club's owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]]. In 2008 the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], a Sydney NRL club, and the South Australian Government announced a three-year contract in which the Sharks would play a single home game each season at Hindmarsh. Unfortunately this only happened for 2009. From 2010 the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] signed an agreement to play one home game per season at the Adelaide Oval for three years with the hope of establishing a strong supporter base in Adelaide.

Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] who play in the [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] and the women's team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] who play in the [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]]. Both teams play their home games at the [[Adelaide Arena]]. Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], who play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the [[ANZ Championship]], with home games played at [[ETSA Park]]. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, while international netball matches are usually played at either the Entertainment Centre or the Adelaide Arena.
[[File:Tourdownunder2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tour Down Under]] is the first event of the [[UCI World Tour]] calendar. ]]
Since 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the [[Tour Down Under]] [[Bicycle racing|bicycle race]], organised and directed by Adelaide based [[Mike Turtur]]. Turtur won an [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] for Australia in the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|4000m Team pursuit]] at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympics]]. The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted [[UCI ProTour]] status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the [[Australian Baseball League]], the [[Adelaide Bite]]. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium is [[Coopers Stadium]]. Their name stems from the local [[Great Australian Bight]], and from the abundance of local [[Great White Shark]]s. Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, &quot;Adelaide Adrenaline&quot; in the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] (AIHL). They were national champions in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaideadrenaline.com.au/|title=adelaideadrenaline.com.au|work=Adelaide Adrenaline 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Grand Prix]] for [[Formula One]] racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] which was laid out in the city's eastern parklands.&lt;ref name=&quot;f1-move&quot;/&gt; The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] for [[V8 Supercar]] racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbowls2012.com/|title=worldbowls2012.com|work=Independent Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996. [[Dirt track racing|Dirt track speedway]] is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. [[Speedway City]], located adjacent to the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] at [[Virginia, South Australia|Virginia]] ({{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979. [[Gillman Speedway]] located in the semi-industrial suburb of [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]], has been in operation since 1998 and caters to [[Motorcycle speedway]] (including [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecars]]), while the [[Sidewinders Speedway]] is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978.

===Health===
[[File:SAHMRI Adelaide SA.jpg|thumb|right|The South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) located on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]].]]
Adelaide's first hospital is the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH). Founded in 1840, it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Adelaide. It has a capacity of 705 beds. Two other RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. Five other large public hospitals in the Adelaide area are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), which is on King William Road in North Adelaide; the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (340 beds) in Woodville, the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] (580 beds) in Bedford Park, the [[Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park]] (300 beds) in Daw Park, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools. The Women's and Children's, the Queen Elizabeth and the Lyell McEwin are affiliated with the [[University of Adelaide]], Flinders Medical Centre is affiliated [[Flinders University]], and the Lyell McEwin is also affiliated with the [[University of South Australia]].

In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. The new 800-bed hospital has a cost of A$1.85 billion and was planned to be named the &quot;Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital&quot; after the [[Marjorie Jackson|former Governor of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Owen | first = Michael | title =800 beds, helipad and train station: Our 'Marj' hospital | newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page = 5 | date = 7 June 2007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility. Construction started in June 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahp.com.au/index.php/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions - General|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, major upgrades were announced to see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] in Elizabeth become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the [[Modbury Hospital]] and the Noarlunga Hospital were to become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital was also to expand its range of speciality areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=1712 |title='News: New $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion hospital spearheads health reform' |publisher=Ministers.sa.gov.au |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the &quot;Global Financial Crisis&quot; of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.

The largest not-for-profit provider of community health care within Adelaide is the [[Royal District Nursing Service (South Australia)]]  which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care, which in turn eases pressure on the South Australia public hospital system.

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[File:CT 203 king william, 2014.JPG|right|thumb|A tram in King William Street.]]
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]] (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]]. There are further plans to extend the tram to [[Port Adelaide]] and [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]]. A [[Central Business District|CBD]] tram loop too, is being considered and the latest [[Adelaide Airport]] master plan has also revealed a tram extension to the airport in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/city-loop-in-tram-proposal/story-e6frea6u-1226032608322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/assets/pdfs/master-planning/Vol2MaterPlanDec2009.pdf |format=Pdf |title=Master Plan – Adelaide Airport |publisher=adelaideairport.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |format=PDF |year=2005|url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008}} (1.18MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:
*The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (colloquially referred to as the freeway), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.
*The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the SEXY), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of the Main South Road, taking the peak traffic load into the city in the morning, and out of the city in the evening.
*The [[Port River Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the PREXY), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern &quot;entrance&quot; to the metropolitan area.
*The [[Northern Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the NEXY, formerly referred to as the [[Sturt Highway]] extension), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler bypass road|Gawler Bypass]] to the Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.

There are plans for major upgrades to busy sections of [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], including road widening, underpasses and overpasses. The underpass of [[Anzac Highway]] was completed in 2009. Further planned underpasses during the first stage of the project include Grange Road, Port Road, the Glenelg Tramline and the Outer Harbour railway line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/southroad_upgrade/index.asp ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}} {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/southroad_upgrade/index.asp|date =20110719234054}}{{dead link |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overpass between Regency Road and the Port River Expressway commenced construction in 2012.

====Airports====
[[File:AdelaideAirportSkyline.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adelaide Airport]] is closer to the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] than any other international airport in Australia.]]
The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial Airports, [[Adelaide Airport|Adelaide]] and [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]].

Unusually for a major city, it is only {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the [[Adelaide city centre]].

Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the [[Adelaide Electric Supply Company]], which was nationalised by the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/norrie-sir-charles-willoughby-moke-11254 | title = Biography – Sir Charles Willoughby Moke Norrie | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | author = P.A. Howell | accessdate =16 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the [[SA Power Networks|Electricity Trust of South Australia]] (ETSA), now known as SA Power Networks. Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP [[Trevor Crothers]] resigned from the party and voted with the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricity-week.com.au/erisk7/article/315187/function.pg-connect&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58398249.html|title=South Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110318191.html|title=Power crisis 'as bad as California'.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115625174.html|title=Privatisation 'will cost state billions'.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These price increases and large subsides have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/renewables-blowout-as-wind-solar-hit-harder-than-tax/story-fn59niix-1226397210436 | title = Renewables blowout as wind, solar hit harder than tax | publisher = The Australian | author1 = Sid Maher | author2 = Michael Owen | date = 16 June 2011 | accessdate =16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/power-prices-to-be-highest-in-the-world/story-e6frea83-1226305741810 | title = South Australia's power prices set to become highest in the world says Energy Users Association of Australia | author = Claire Peddie | publisher = AdelaideNow | date = 21 March 2012 | accessdate =16 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SA Power Networks now distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users. Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are: [[TRUenergy]], which generates electricity; [[ElectraNet]], which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network, [[Lumo Energy]] and [[AGL Energy]], which retails gas and electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnergySA1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Industry structure | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&amp;tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044124/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&amp;tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.

Adelaide derives most of its electricity from a gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] at [[Torrens Island Power Station, South Australia|Torrens Island]], with more coming from power stations at [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Pelican Point Power Station|Pelican Point]], and from connections to the national grid. Gas is mainly supplied from the [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]] Gas Processing Plant in the [[Cooper Basin]], and is piped to Adelaide and other areas within the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnergySA2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Supply Security | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&amp;tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044821/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&amp;tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Australia also generates 18% of its electricity from [[wind power]], and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water,+energy+and+environment/Energy/Renewable+energy/Wind+energy/Wind+energy+in+South+Australia | title = Wind Energy in South Australia | publisher = Government of South Australia | accessdate =16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. A [[Adelaide Desalination Plant|sea water desalination plant]] capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) was opened in 2013. The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].
